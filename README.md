# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking cells on the grid, and the first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the grid is full and no player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
